##  ♠️♥️♣️♦️  Welcome to "Blackjack by Womack"  ♠️♥️♣️♦️

Browser game built from scrath with  _Developer Level:_ __"2 weeks in"__  skills!


### _Technologies Used:_ 

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript


### _Project Goals:_ 

* Get practice using separation of the view logic (display) and business logic (application)
* 
* __Be less of a noob and get more 1337__


### _Pseudocode:_



Some of the app's features may need to be pseudocoded, that is, outlining the app's logic in a plain, informal way.
Pseudocode the app's overall functionality first.
More detailed pseudocode for a given feature may be required later.
Analyze the application's state (data)

What does the application need to "remember" throughout its execution?


Note that in an application with a database, we would analyze the database design during this step.
Set up the project

### _User Stories:_

* "The app's features, from the user's point of view, should be described using User Stories. User stories follow this template: As a [role], I want [feature] because [reason]. Example user story: As a player, I want to see a list of high-scores so that I know what I have to score to make the list."

* When user hits play button, cards are dealt per wireframe
* User has ability to see dealer's face up card and theirs
* Choice to either "hit" or "stand" or "fold" 
* Dealer logic of "soft"/"hard" cards and if they need to "hit" 
* Limit of how many cards can be used to "hit" based on 21 limit
* Comparison of user cards to dealer cards
* Message of Win/Loss/Push to user
* Ability to deal a new hand

Potential upgrades once the game logic is functioning:

* CSS Styling: cards, chips, backgrounds, etc.
* Able to place bets (bonus items would be doubling down)
* Function for "what the book says" to do based on players hand
* Feature to allow 1 deck or multi-deck
