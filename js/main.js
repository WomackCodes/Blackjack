"For example, you might decide to model a game of tic-tac-toe using 
the values of 1, -1 or null to represent whether a square holds 
Player X, Player O, or nobody, respectively. However, when it comes 
time to transfer the app's state to the DOM, you can visualize the 
state anyway you want, e.g., a value of 1 is "rendered" with a 
certain image, etc."

    * IDEA - make cards assigned to this value strategy when 
    rendered they can be tied to a numerical value tied to suit and 
    card #
